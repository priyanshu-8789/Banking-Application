In this project, I created a mini-application for a banking system in Java. In this program, I added some basic functionalities of a bank account like a deposit of amount, withdrawal of amount, etc.

Initially, the program accepts the number of customers we need to add and adds the customer and account details accordingly. Further, it displays the series of menus to operate over the accounts.

The series of menus displayed are as follows:
1. Display all account details
2. Search by account number
3. Deposit the amount
4. Withdraw the amount
5. Exit
